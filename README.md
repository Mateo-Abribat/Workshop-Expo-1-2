# Workshop-Expo-1-2

## Project setup

1. Before starting the project, set it up following the instructions in the `Setup` section.

## Introduction

This project is an introduction to Expo, where you will implement a basic screen with different components.

## First step

1. Play with different components in React Native:
   - Create a view with the text "Hello World".
   - Customize the view with a style (width, height, background, etc.).

## Second step

1. Create a text input with the native component `TextInput`.
2. Display the content of the text input in real time below it.
   - You can check the documentation of react native `TextInput` [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput).
   - Also try to play with `useEffect` function to see how it works: [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html).
